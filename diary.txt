18.12:
contours are cool
19.12:
Switched from haarcascade to contours
8.1:
    GOALS:
        - (CLEARED 8.1) Make the tracking work on the hole, not the hand.
        - (CLEARED 9.1) Learn cascade hierarchy, implement it.
        - (CLEARED 19.1) Fix not registering when had is far away due to area differences (ADDED 9.1)
        - Implement brightness control in dark areas (ADDED 10.1 HACKATHON)
        - (CLEARED 19.1) Investigate the possibility of different gesture detection than of ok sign, perhaps implement.
        - Activation on computer wakeup, or activation passively.
5.2:
    New goals after talk with eran from general motors:
        - (CLEARED 6.2) Investigate Histogram equalization and Otsu technique
        - (CLEARED 6.2) Install python 64 bit, allowing to install pytorch through this link: https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch-1.4.0%2Bcpu-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl
        - Investigate how transferal learning works
        - Use the neural network models in torchvision's tutorial
        - Utilize a hand detection class

    Steps in learning:
        6.2:
            (CLEARED 6.2) Wrote program to capture images and masks for training data
            (ADDED 9.2) try and implement learning model from pytorch's website
